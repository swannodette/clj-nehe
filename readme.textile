h1. Running the Tutorials

You need to have installed "Leiningen 1.1.0":http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen. Once you've done that you can run the following if you're using Emacs/SLIME or Enclojure:

<pre class="console">
lein deps
lein native-deps
lein swank
</pre>

You can then connect to this REPL. In Emacs/SLIME this can be done with *M-x slime-connect* and just press the enter key twice to use the defaults.

I highly recommend using Emacs/SLIME or Enclojure. It's useful when you're starting out to be able to jump to source definitions in Penumbra. In Emacs this can be done with *M-.* (that's *Meta-period*).

h1. Tricks

If you pass a display proxy function to your app you can interact with the tutorials without having to restart the application completely. No if you redefine *display* or any of the functions it calls your Penumbra app will update immediately. Interactive coding for the win!

<pre>
(defn display [[delta time] state]
  (clear)
  (gl-load-identity-matrix)
  (translate -1.5 0.0 -6.0)
  (draw-triangles
   (doall (map #(apply vertex %) *tri*)))
  (translate 3.0 0.0 0.0)
  (draw-quads
   (doall (map #(apply vertex %) *sqr*)))
  (app/repaint!))

(defn display-proxy [& args]
  (apply display args))

(def app-options {:reshape reshape
                  :display display-proxy
                  :init init})

(defn start []
  (app/start app-options {}))
</pre>

h2. Missing functions

Some of the OpenGL API exposed by Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) has not been brought into Penumbra. However it's simple to import these things yourself with *gl-import*. For example *glClearDepth* has not been imported, but you just can import it yourself like so:

<pre>
(gl-import glClearDepth clear-depth)
</pre>

h2. Signatures

The signatures of your methods are *really* important. For example if you provide a reshape fn it must look something like the following:

<pre>
(defn reshape [[x y width height] state]
  ...)
</pre>

It also important that if you use *app/start* with options you must also pass in a map for the state.

<pre>
(app/start callback-map {})
</pre>

If you don't your program will crash immediately.
